    WHAT IS JAVA?
Java is a popular programming language and It is owned by Oracle.
It is used for:
-Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
-Desktop applications
-Web applications
-Web servers and application servers
-Games
-Database connection And much, much more!
    Why Use Java?
-Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).
-It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
-Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows
code to be reused, lowering development costs.
    How to write Java code(syntax)
-In Java, every application begins with a class name
-The class must match the filename.
-The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.
    The main method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program.
Any code inside the main() method will be executed.
The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
    System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen/console.
-System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output".
You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
    Print Text
-println() method, short for "print line", is used to print/output a value to the screen (or a file).
You can add as many println() methods as you want.
Note that it will add a new line for each method.
-Double Quotes
Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
-print() method: which is similar to println()
The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output.
    Print Numbers
You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes.
    Java Comments
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable.
It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
-Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
-Java Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.
    Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
In Java, there are different types of variables, for example
-String: stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes.
-int: stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.
-float: stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.
-char: stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.
-boolean: stores values with two states: true or false.
    Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable in Java, you need to:
-Choose a type (like int or String).
-Give the variable a name (like x, age, or name).
-Optionally assign it a value using "=".
Syntax
type variableName = value;
    Final Variables
If you don't want to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword
(this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only).
    Display Variables
The println() method is often used to display variables.
    The + operator
-To combine both text and a variable, use the + character.
-You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable.
-For numeric values, the + character works as a mathematical operator
-To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list.
    Java Identifiers
All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code
    The general rules for naming variables are:
-Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
-Names must begin with a letter.
-Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace.
-Names can also begin with $ and _.
-Names are case-sensitive.
-Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names.
